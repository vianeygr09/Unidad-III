            Coffe preparation is the process of turning coffe beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with
                the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the
                process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans must
                be rosted, the roasted coffe beans must then be
                ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot
                water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the
                liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.

            Espresso`s authentic formula is clear and basic, its propper
                execution a matter of training, experience and natural
                talent. A jet of hot water at 88º-93ºC (190º-200ºF)
                passes under a pressure of nine or more atmospheres
                trough a seven-gram (.25 oz) cake-like layer of ground
                and tamped coffee. Done rigth, the result is a
                concentrate of not more than 30 ml (one oz) of pure
                sensorial pleasure

            While it is less likely that anyone would do this on their
                own if they are not a beekeeper, this might be useful
                for those who aspire to become one.
            Bees are really great and easy to keep, even in the urban
                enviroment! As Novrlla Carpenter calls them, bees are
                &quot;gateway animal for urban farmers&quot;. All you
                need is some space in the backyard/deck.
            The process of honey harvesting and extraction most likely
                happens on a separate days. These are the tools
                required:
